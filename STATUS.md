# STATUS — REA_Web / 2026-10-25 KST

**CURRENT PHASE:** Day1 runnable MVP verified; Day2 Fable→Astra adapter READY. Do not claim the full integrated product is complete.

## DONE with verified evidence
1. Repo architecture / branch structure / safety / roadmap documented; GitHub hibi89/REA_Web.
2. Fable source ZIP `source/` 88/88 paths imported unchanged from pinned upstream commit `bbe72c0acd3a3e355062d6bd0d866af33e5274b0` onto `import/fable51-bbe72c0` @ `7e6f273b359b207fad8f92016226e3058cbcb839`. Eight upstream Git blob path manifests; sentinel source hashes matched.
3. Astra P4 **PARTIAL** import: 103 selected paths including all 41 `astra_contracts` modules, pinned `b3166b67604381a9d2afd41667b65f9a9b103b37`; `import/astra-p4-b3166b6` @ `f044b66e799289a5a353fdb9cbfdb324e683ffa3`, nine manifests; sentinel source hashes matched. Not full Astra checkout.
4. `feature/csv-local-mvp` @ `5515a7286d63211e32d2c577f93f77d61f37ce08`, Draft PR #3 to integration/develop: CSV → isolated SQLite → independent FastAPI+HTML/CSS/JS app with list/search/category filter/detail.
5. **Actual tested run:** https://github.com/hibi89/REA_Web/actions/runs/40198326369, job `121183903206`, Ubuntu Python 3.11: 9 pytest PASS / 1 warning, CLI generated synthetic Korean café demo (5 rows), compileall PASS, **real Chromium** filter/search/detail/reload PASS, no JavaScript exceptions or external calls.
6. Draft PR #1 Fable, #2 Astra, #3 MVP exist; none has been merged to main/develop in this verified checkpoint.
7. Source QA helper branches `qa/vendor-fable`, `qa/vendor-astra` configured with SHA checker/workflow; any actual all-file Actions PASS remains separately unverified.

## NEXT READY: REA-MVP-D2-01
Branch: `feature/evidence-adapter`.
Implement code (not another plan) to bridge actual Fable result.json to Astra ObservationBundle/FunctionalSpecDraft **review-only** proposal. Include redacted synthetic fixture, >=15 positive/negative tests if feasible, CLI, and actual test evidence. Preserve uncertainty and approval gate. Feature branch was baseline-only at prior checkpoint; inspect fresh HEAD.

Then D2-02 optional bridge + CSV builder and D3 gap matrix/3 synthetic domain examples/Windows smoke/packaging. See `docs/17_NEXT_TASK.md`.

## NOT DONE / blockers
- No new REA end-to-end Fable→Astra→generated-app run; no arbitrary URL clone; no customer/live DB credentials, HTTPS hosting, complex auth/payment or deployment.
- Day1 browser acceptance is Linux Chromium synthetic only; Windows and real customer data NOT_RUN.
- Vendor snapshots are Draft/unmerged; Astra subset incomplete; later upstream codex P4 Windows suite had 96 FAIL/108 ERROR, untriaged and not treated as REA pass.
- Original full final-design completeness and 30만원 commercial readiness NOT established; 3-day target is aspirational.
- Advanced penetration tests, distribution-license audit, packaging and robust recovery remain.

## New-session start
Exact user sentence **[REA_Web 깃헙 레포지토리 보고 작업이어가셈]** gives an immediate go-ahead for this READY safe task. Read `WORKER_START_HERE.md` / `docs/SESSION_RESTART_PROTOCOL.md`, current remote HEAD first. No extra owner question; implement/verify/commit then update this file and HANDOFF/NEXT_TASK.
