# REA_Web — engineering agent policy (canonical)

Read `WORKER_START_HERE.md` and `docs/SESSION_RESTART_PROTOCOL.md` first, followed by remote `STATUS.md`, `HANDOFF.md` and `docs/17_NEXT_TASK.md`. Use latest actual GitHub state, not previously written chat assumptions.

**Restart trigger:** `[REA_Web 깃헙 레포지토리 보고 작업이어가셈]` means **inspect repository and execute next safe READY task immediately**. It already has the meaning of `ㄱ`. Do not ask user to resend ZIP, choose branch, confirm the existing design or approve normal synthetic development. User specifically wants completed work, not status-only replies.

Project: integrate Fable 5.1 analysis with Astra Web Catcher evidence/functional spec and an independently generated customer-data-based webapp. D1 generated readonly FastAPI/SQLite from CSV; D2-01 implemented the review-only Fable/Astra adapter; D2-02 implemented the combined CSV-only/optional Fable report orchestration with 55 tests and actual Chromium PASS on feature/orchestrator. D3-01 3-domain Chromium, reproducible ZIP and native Windows CMD/API verified (Linux and Windows 68 pytest each), still unmerged. Next D4-01 = bounded CSV schema preview and category summary on a new feature branch. Main remains a docs baseline, not a runnable merged product.

Development order: real MVP -> compare target architecture -> fill gaps -> robust tests and sale readiness. Follow docs/17_NEXT_TASK.md; do not repeat verified D1/D2/D3. Three-day completion is a stretch goal. Respect evidence/permission boundaries and strictly limited 300,000 KRW product; no mandatory collecting customer data or touching live DB.

**Branch discipline:** Do not modify upstream Fable/Astra repositories or pinned import branch snapshots. Work on dispatch target branches, preserve existing unique commits, and maintain Draft PRs until verification. Don't merge incomplete source snapshots blindly. Status-only edits never count as implementation.

**Truthful QA:** capture tested SHA, exact command, OS, PASS/FAIL/SKIP. No unrun claim, silent approval, production deployment, customer data, credentials or payment/complex-auth integration. Non-deferable protection: no overwrite, bounded inputs, safe escaping, parameterized SQL, localhost-only. Advanced security reviews can be late, but are needed before real customer deployment.

**Handoff:** After each unit update main STATUS/HANDOFF/NEXT_TASK; if some writes blocked by conflicts, report precisely and proceed safely. Two repeated failures => switch approach. If a task is blocked for owner approval, mark it BLOCKED and work on next safe independent item. Next reply must be a substantive development result, not another request for permission.
